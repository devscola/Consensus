# Consensus

## Preconfiguration of linux systems at no dockerized environment

Install Ruby, Ruby-dev and Ruby-rack:

~~~
sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-dev ruby-rack
~~~

Visit nokogiri page ( http://www.nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html ) and install dependencies, in debian/ubuntu:

~~~
sudo apt-get install build-essential patch
sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev liblzma-dev libxslt-dev libxml2-dev
~~~

For web-test install chromedriver (webdriver):

~~~
sudo apt-get install chromium-chromedriver
~~~

or manually install:

~~~
wget https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/2.29/chromedriver_linux64.zip
sudo unzip -e chromedriver_linux64.zip -d /usr/local/bin/;
~~~

or install from pip:

~~~
sudo apt install python-pip python-dev build-essential
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install chromedriver
~~~


## Install gems


*Bundler* gem has to be installed first:

~~~
sudo gem install rerun
sudo gem install rake
sudo gem install sinatra
sudo gem install capybara
sudo gem install selenium-webdriver
sudo gem install bundler
~~~

Install Rspec and Nokogiri:

~~~
sudo gem install rspec
sudo gem install nokogiri
~~~


### install the gems in the local folder of the project
~~~
bundle install --path vendor/bundle
~~~

If bundle install fail, use *sudo*


## Run tests in local environment:


1. Download consensus git: 

~~~
git clone https://github.com/devscola/consensus
~~~


2.  To run the test you must have the Consensus app up:

First run Rake:

~~~
rake
~~~

That will raise the Consensus web in your localhost:4567

Then in other terminal you can run the tests with:

All the tests:

     

~~~
rake test
~~~


The unitarian spec tests:


~~~
rake tdd
~~~


The behauvior spec tests:


~~~
rake bdd
~~~

To run specific test you can do it like this:
       
~~~
rspec -e 'any word of the test title' 
~~~

## To tag a test and run it in Consensus

**1ยบ.-** To tag a specific test, we have to write after the test name the tag that we want to use, with a comma and the _:tag_name_ as follows:

~~~
it 'test_name', :example do
   _Arrange_
   _Add_
   _Assert_
 end
~~~
 
In this case,  _example_ is the tag that we are using.

**2ยบ.-** To run the specific test with this tag, you can do it this way:

~~~
rake tag[example]
~~~
